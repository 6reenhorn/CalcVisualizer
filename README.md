# Calculus-Powered Graphing App

## Introduction
This project is a Python-based application designed to visualize mathematical functions along with their derivatives and integrals. It serves as a hands-on practice in numerical methods, computational calculus, and desktop application development. Created as part of our calculus subject project, this tool helps explore the practical applications of differentiation and integration in data analysis, physics simulations, and more.

## Features
- Input mathematical functions in Python syntax (e.g., `x**2 + 3*x + 5`).
- Compute and visualize:
  - The original function
  - Its first derivative (using numerical differentiation)
  - Its integral (using numerical integration)
- Interactive graph display using Matplotlib.
- User-defined range for function evaluation.
- Simple user interface (CLI or basic GUI with Tkinter).

## Future Enhancements (Optional Extensions)
- Higher-order derivatives computation.
- Advanced GUI using PyQt.
- Exporting graphs as images.

## License
This project is for educational purposes and is open for further improvements.
