# Calculus-Powered Graphing App
## Introduction
This project is a Python-based application designed to visualize mathematical functions along with their derivatives and integrals. It serves as a hands-on practice in numerical methods, computational calculus, and desktop application development. Created as part of our calculus subject project, this tool helps explore the practical applications of differentiation and integration in data analysis, physics simulations, and more.

## Features
-- Input mathematical functions in Python syntax (e.g., x**2 + 3*x + 5).
--- Compute and visualize:
